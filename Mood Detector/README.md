A sample Python app for a Raspberry Pi built using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) that takes picture and uses a TensorFlow lite model created using [Lobe](https://www.lobe.ai/) to detect whether the mood of the person in the picture is positive (thumb up) or negative (thumb down). The model file is not included in the repo.

A full walkthrough can be found in [Creating a Mood Detector using Lobe and a Raspberry Pi](https://brendg.co.uk/2021/07/26/creating-a-mood-detector-using-lobe-and-a-raspberry-pi/).
